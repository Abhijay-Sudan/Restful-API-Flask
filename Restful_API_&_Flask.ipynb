        "# Restful API & Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "  - A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). It allows communication between client and server using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API Specification.\n",
        "  - An API specification is a detailed document or standard that describes how an API works. It defines endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and expected behaviors. API specifications help developers understand how to interact with an API without needing access to its internal code. Examples include OpenAPI and Swagger.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "  - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is popular for building APIs because it is lightweight, flexible, easy to learn, and supports extensions like Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Flask allows developers to create web applications and APIs quickly with minimal setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "  - Routing in Flask refers to the mechanism of directing incoming HTTP requests to specific functions based on the URL. Flask uses the @app.route() decorator to bind a URL path to a function, which then returns a response to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "  - To create a simple Flask application:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Import Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Create an app instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Define a route using @app.route().\n",
        "\n",
        "    Run the application using app.run().\n",
        "\n",
        "This creates a basic web server that listens for incoming requests and returns responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "  - The common HTTP methods in RESTful APIs are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    GET: Retrieve data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    POST: Submit or create data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    PUT: Update existing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    DELETE: Remove data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    PATCH: Partially update data.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods define the operation to be performed on a resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "  - The @app.route() decorator is used to map a specific URL to a function. This allows Flask to know which function to call when a particular endpoint is accessed by a user.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "  - GET is used to request data from a server. Parameters are passed in the URL and it is idempotent (does not change server data).\n",
        "\n",
        "    POST is used to send data to the server for creation or processing. Data is included in the request body and may change server state.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "  - Flask provides a way to handle errors using error handlers. Developers can define custom responses for HTTP error codes using the @app.errorhandler() decorator. This helps to return user-friendly messages and prevent server crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "   - To connect Flask to a SQL database, use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. It requires configuring a database URI and creating a database instance using SQLAlchemy(app). Models can then be defined as Python classes and mapped to database tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "   - Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy with Flask. It simplifies database operations and allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects rather than writing SQL queries directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "  - Blueprints in Flask are components that allow for modular application design. They help organize code by grouping related routes and logic. Blueprints make it easier to manage large applications by breaking them into smaller, reusable parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask’s request object?\n",
        "   - The request object in Flask provides access to incoming request data, such as form inputs, JSON payloads, headers, and query parameters. It is used to extract and process the data sent by the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "   - To create a RESTful endpoint, define a function and map it to a route using the @app.route() decorator. Set the allowed HTTP methods, and return a response in a suitable format (usually JSON).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask’s jsonify() function?\n",
        "   - The jsonify() function converts Python dictionaries or lists into a JSON response, automatically setting the Content-Type header to application/json. This makes it easy to return structured data to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        "   - The url_for() function generates URLs for specific functions defined in the application. It helps in building dynamic URLs, avoiding hardcoded paths, and improves maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "   - Flask serves static files from a folder named static by default. Files such as CSS and JavaScript can be placed in this directory and accessed via url_for('static', filename='filename.css').\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "   - An API specification outlines how the API works, what endpoints are available, what data is expected, and what responses are returned. It acts as a contract between backend and frontend developers, ensuring consistent communication and easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "   - HTTP status codes indicate the result of a request. They inform the client whether the request was successful (e.g., 200 OK), had client-side errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request), or server-side issues (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error). Proper use improves API clarity and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "   - To handle POST requests:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Define a route that allows POST methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Use request.form or request.get_json() to extract data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Process the data and return a response, typically with a 201 status code for creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "   - Securing a Flask API involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Using HTTPS to encrypt data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Validating and sanitizing inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Implementing authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Applying authorization checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Limiting request rates (rate limiting).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Avoiding exposure of sensitive data in error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "   - Flask-RESTful simplifies building REST APIs by providing classes like Resource, request parsers, and better structure. It supports better organization, consistent response formatting, and simplifies method handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "   - The session object in Flask stores data across requests for individual users. It is useful for maintaining user state (e.g., logged-in status). Flask stores session data in secure cookies on the client side.\n",
